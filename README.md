# AOWTraining


# Info: 
Maps for training Warcraft3 AOW creepcamps. Made by Gindo70 with amazing help of Krawty.


I recommend playing this in Singleplayer, this way you can restart the mission in the menu.
Losing any Unit, including Whips or KOTG treants will result in a loose screen. At Amazonia you are supposed to kill the small camp as well.

# Installation:

1. Download the repository using the green button at the top right.
2. Unzip the files. 
3. Copy the w3m files to C:\Users\User\Documents\Warcraft III\Maps\Download\

Feel free to contact me or open issues for bugs and ideas.
